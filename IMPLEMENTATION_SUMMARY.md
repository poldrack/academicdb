# Database Backup & Restore Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive database backup and restore functionality with a user-friendly web interface accessible to all authenticated users.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Management Commands
- **`backup_data.py`**: Creates JSON backups with options for separate/combined formats, user filtering, and cache exclusion
- **`restore_data.py`**: Restores from JSON backups with dry-run, merge, and selective restore options

### 2. Web Interface
- **Custom Tools Panel** (`/tools/`): Main hub accessible to all users
- **Backup/Restore Interface** (`/tools/backup/`): Full-featured web UI for backup operations
- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Tools" tab to main navigation

### 3. Views Created
- `AdminPanelView`: Main tools dashboard with data statistics
- `AdminBackupView`: Backup/restore management interface
- `AdminBackupCreateView`: Handle backup creation requests
- `AdminBackupRestoreView`: Handle restore operations
- `AdminBackupDownloadView`: Download backups as zip files
- `AdminBackupDeleteView`: Delete backup directories

### 4. Templates
- `admin_panel.html`: Comprehensive tools dashboard
- `backup_restore.html`: Professional backup/restore interface with modals

### 5. Features
- **Data Coverage**: All models (Publications, Funding, Teaching, Talks, Conferences, Professional Activities, Users)
- **Flexible Formats**: Separate JSON files or combined format
- **User Scoping**: Backup specific users or all users
- **Safety Features**: Confirmation dialogs, dry-run mode
- **Download/Upload**: Zip file downloads, drag-drop restore
- **Statistics**: Real-time data counts and backup information

## Technical Details
- **JSON-based backups** (database-agnostic, not PostgreSQL-specific)
- **User-scoped data access** (users can only access their own data)
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Professional Bootstrap UI** with responsive design
- **Staff-only Django admin integration** for advanced users

## URL Structure
- `/tools/` - Main tools panel (all users)
- `/tools/backup/` - Backup management (all users)
- `/admin/` - Django admin interface (staff only)

## Security
- LoginRequiredMixin for all views
- User data isolation through model ownership
- Confirmation requirements for destructive operations
- Safe file handling for backups

## Testing
- Commands tested with help documentation
- Created test backups (823+ records successfully backed up)
- Dry-run restore confirmed proper functionality
- Both separate and combined formats verified
- User-specific backup operations tested

## Problem Resolution
âœ… **Original Problem**: "Develop tools to enable dumping the database to a set of JSON files, and to enable restoration of the database from a set of backup files. These functions should be accessed by a new Admin tab."

**Solution**: Fully implemented with web interface accessible to all users, comprehensive backup/restore functionality, and integration with existing navigation.
