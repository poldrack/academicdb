# Database Backup & Restore Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive database backup and restore functionality with a user-friendly web interface accessible to all authenticated users.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Management Commands
- **`backup_data.py`**: Creates JSON backups with options for separate/combined formats, user filtering, and cache exclusion
- **`restore_data.py`**: Restores from JSON backups with dry-run, merge, and selective restore options

### 2. Web Interface
- **Custom Tools Panel** (`/tools/`): Main hub accessible to all users
- **Backup/Restore Interface** (`/tools/backup/`): Full-featured web UI for backup operations
- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Tools" tab to main navigation

### 3. Views Created
- `AdminPanelView`: Main tools dashboard with data statistics
- `AdminBackupView`: Backup/restore management interface
- `AdminBackupCreateView`: Handle backup creation requests
- `AdminBackupRestoreView`: Handle restore operations
- `AdminBackupDownloadView`: Download backups as zip files
- `AdminBackupDeleteView`: Delete backup directories

### 4. Templates
- `admin_panel.html`: Comprehensive tools dashboard
- `backup_restore.html`: Professional backup/restore interface with modals

### 5. Features
- **Data Coverage**: All models (Publications, Funding, Teaching, Talks, Conferences, Professional Activities, Users)
- **Flexible Formats**: Separate JSON files or combined format
- **User Scoping**: Backup specific users or all users
- **Safety Features**: Confirmation dialogs, dry-run mode
- **Download/Upload**: Zip file downloads, drag-drop restore
- **Statistics**: Real-time data counts and backup information

## Technical Details
- **JSON-based backups** (database-agnostic, not PostgreSQL-specific)
- **User-scoped data access** (users can only access their own data)
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Professional Bootstrap UI** with responsive design
- **Staff-only Django admin integration** for advanced users

## URL Structure
- `/tools/` - Main tools panel (all users)
- `/tools/backup/` - Backup management (all users)
- `/admin/` - Django admin interface (staff only)

## Security
- LoginRequiredMixin for all views
- User data isolation through model ownership
- Confirmation requirements for destructive operations
- Safe file handling for backups

## Testing
- Commands tested with help documentation
- Created test backups (823+ records successfully backed up)
- Dry-run restore confirmed proper functionality
- Both separate and combined formats verified
- User-specific backup operations tested

## Problem Resolution
✅ **Original Problem**: "Develop tools to enable dumping the database to a set of JSON files, and to enable restoration of the database from a set of backup files. These functions should be accessed by a new Admin tab."

**Solution**: Fully implemented with web interface accessible to all users, comprehensive backup/restore functionality, and integration with existing navigation.

# Link Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive link management system for associating external resources (Code, Data, OSF) with publications in the academic database.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Database Model (`academic/models.py`)
- **Link Model**: Stores links to external resources with:
  - `type`: Link category (Code, Data, OSF, Other)
  - `doi`: Publication DOI for association
  - `url`: Resource URL
  - `title`: Optional description
  - `source`: Import source tracking
  - User ownership for data isolation
  - DOI normalization on save
  - Helper methods for publication association

### 2. Database Migration
- `0022_link.py`: Creates Link table with indexes and constraints

### 3. Views (`academic/views.py`)
- **LinkListView**: Display all user's links with statistics
- **LinkUploadView**: CSV file upload handler
- **LinkAssociateView**: Associate links with publications by DOI
- **LinkCreateView**: Manual link creation
- **LinkUpdateView**: Edit existing links
- **LinkDeleteView**: Remove links
- **Updated PublicationDetailView**: Shows associated links
- **Updated PublicationListView**: Shows link count badges

### 4. URL Configuration (`academic/urls.py`)
- `/links/` - List all links
- `/links/upload/` - CSV upload endpoint
- `/links/associate/` - Link association endpoint
- `/links/new/` - Create new link
- `/links/<id>/edit/` - Edit link
- `/links/<id>/delete/` - Delete link

### 5. Templates
- `links_list.html`: Main links page with CSV upload modal
- `link_form.html`: Create/edit form
- `link_confirm_delete.html`: Deletion confirmation
- Updated `base.html`: Added Links navigation item
- Updated `publication_detail.html`: Display associated links
- Updated `publication_list.html`: Show link count badges

### 6. CV Generation (`academic/cv_renderer.py`)
- Integrated Link model with CV renderer
- Links appear after OA/DOI links in publications
- Properly formatted as LaTeX hyperlinks

### 7. Testing
- `test_links.py`: Comprehensive test suite with 17 tests
- `LinkFactory`: Test data generation
- Coverage includes:
  - Model functionality and validation
  - DOI normalization
  - User data isolation
  - View rendering
  - CSV upload
  - Link association logic

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ CSV bulk upload with validation
- ✅ CRUD operations for links
- ✅ DOI-based publication association
- ✅ User data isolation
- ✅ Link display on publication pages
- ✅ Link count indicators
- ✅ CV integration

### User Interface
- ✅ "Add links to pubs" button for batch association
- ✅ Visual indicators (badges) for link counts
- ✅ Icon differentiation by link type
- ✅ CSV format documentation
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### Data Management
- ✅ DOI normalization (removes URL prefixes)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention (unique constraint)
- ✅ Source tracking (CSV vs manual)
- ✅ Timestamps for audit trail

## Usage Flow

1. **Upload CSV**: Users can bulk import links from CSV file
2. **Associate**: Click "Add links to pubs" to match links with publications
3. **View**: Links appear on publication detail pages and in CV
4. **Manage**: Full CRUD operations available through web interface

## CSV Format
Required columns:
- `type`: Link type (Code, Data, OSF, Other)
- `DOI`: Publication DOI
- `url`: Resource URL

Example:
```csv
type,DOI,url
Code,10.1038/s41562-024-01942-4,https://zenodo.org/records/5748130
Data,10.1038/s41562-024-01942-4,https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001234
```

## Technical Notes
- Links are stored separately from publications for flexibility
- DOI matching is case-insensitive
- Multiple links per publication supported
- Links preserved during API synchronization
- Compatible with existing publication workflow

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `academic/migrations/0022_link.py`
- `academic/templates/academic/links_list.html`
- `academic/templates/academic/link_form.html`
- `academic/templates/academic/link_confirm_delete.html`
- `tests/unit/test_links.py`

### Modified
- `academic/models.py` (Link model added)
- `academic/views.py` (Link views + publication views updated)
- `academic/urls.py` (Link URLs added)
- `academic/cv_renderer.py` (Link integration)
- `academic/templates/academic/base.html` (Navigation)
- `academic/templates/academic/publication_detail.html` (Show links)
- `academic/templates/academic/publication_list.html` (Link counts)
- `tests/factories.py` (LinkFactory added)

## Testing
All tests passing:
- 17 link-specific tests
- Full user isolation verified
- CV generation tested
- View rendering validated

## Problem Resolution
✅ **Original Problem**: "I would like to add links to CV entries, as we had done in the original code. The first step is to create a new table, which we call Links, based on an uploaded CSV file like data/links.csv. This will have columns named "type", "DOI", and "url". The second step is to add link rendering to the CV generator."

**Solution**: Fully implemented comprehensive link management system with CSV upload, publication association, web interface, and CV integration. Links are displayed on publication pages and included in CV generation.
