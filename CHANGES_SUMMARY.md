# CV Generation Bug Fixes - 2025-01-17

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AttributeError: 'Talk' object has no attribute 'virtual'
- **Location**: `academic/cv_renderer.py:351`
- **Problem**: The `get_talks()` function was trying to access a `virtual` attribute that doesn't exist on the Talk model
- **Solution**: Removed the check for `talk.virtual` and updated the section header to remove the note about virtual talks

### 2. UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'logger'
- **Location**: `academic/views.py:1883`
- **Problem**: The exception handler was trying to use `logger` before it was defined in that scope
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate logger import since logger is already imported at module level (line 9)

### 3. Empty Teaching Section in CV
- **Location**: `academic/cv_renderer.py:359-378`
- **Problem**: The `get_teaching()` function was hardcoded to only look for 'undergraduate' and 'graduate' levels, missing any other level values in the database
- **Solution**: Modified function to dynamically get all unique levels from the actual teaching entries and iterate through them

## Files Modified

1. **academic/cv_renderer.py**
   - Removed `talk.virtual` check (line 351-353)
   - Updated section header to remove virtual talks notation (line 342)
   - Fixed `get_teaching()` to dynamically iterate through all teaching levels (lines 368-377)

2. **academic/views.py**
   - Removed duplicate logger import in exception handler (line 1864)

## Impact
These fixes ensure that:
- CV PDF downloads work without AttributeError
- All teaching entries are displayed regardless of their level value
- Error handling works correctly with proper logging
