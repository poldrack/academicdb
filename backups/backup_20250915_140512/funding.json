        "short-description": "Project Summary The NIMH research domain criteria (RDoC) reconceptualizes mental health research along a series of key cross-disorder dimensional constructs. However, these dimensions were determined in a top-down fashion by relatively small groups of researchers. We propose a data-driven approach that tests the validity of the key RDoC constructs of attention, cognitive control, and working memory. We will evaluate these constructs using multiple cognitive tasks per construct to examine their relationship to brain networks and their ability to predict real-world behaviors that are relevant to mental health. Finally, we propose an augmentation to the RDoC framework by adding new units of analysis: contrasts and practice. The current RDoC matrix maps directly from task paradigms to constructs and subconstructs, which is problematic because supposedly distinct constructs can sometimes map to exactly the same set of tasks. To address this, we propose a new RDoC unit of analysis called a “contrast”, which better reflects the usual logic of experimental design. We will identify mappings between cognitive systems constructs and contrasts through consultation with domain experts. We will then acquire a large-scale dataset to test both exploratory and confirmatory models for RDoC cognitive system constructs. Finally, we will evaluate whether these RDoC cognitive systems constructs are predictive of related real-world outcomes. The RDoC matrix links constructs to both behavioral measures and neural circuits, but the present mappings between cognitive systems constructs and brain systems are sparse and inconsistent. We will use a dense- sampling fMRI acquisition of 65 subjects each completing 10 scanning sessions on the same battery of tasks as the behavioral study, to develop a precise data-driven atlas of neural engagement at each level of the matrix, from contrasts to subconstructs to constructs. We will then validate the behaviorally-derived models using neural data, both between subjects and within subjects. We will also perform fully exploratory analyses to identify whether the data-driven neural circuit structure on these tasks diverges from the RDoC matrix. A long history of research in both and animals has shown that repeated practice on a task changes the way that the task is performed and the brain systems that support performance. We will leverage our behavioral and brain imaging samples to evaluate whether the structure of the cognitive systems domain remains constant with practice. In parallel we will also apply exploratory methods to assess the consistency of structural models estimated either early in training or after extensive practice. Overall, this project expands the RDoC matrix with two new units of analysis (contrasts and practice), and validates the constructs of attention, cognitive control, and working memory across both behavior and neural circuits.",

        "short-description": "Project Summary/Abstract The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a BRAIN initiative (R24 MH114705) community-driven standard meant to maximize neuroimaging data sharing, and facilitate analysis tool development. We propose to extend the standard to encompass derivatives resulting from experiments related to both functional as well as structural magnetic resonance imaging data that describe macroscopic brain connectivity estimates. The focus of this proposal is to advance BIDS to describe the entire experimental workflow—from minimally processed anatomical, functional and diffusion MRI data through connectivity matrices and tractometry features—in service of supporting BRAIN initiative studies of large-scale connectivity of human and nonhuman brains. BIDS was initially scoped to MRI data of the brain, but the standard has set up a solid infrastructure to steer the community and has been extended to cover a range of other modalities (PET, EEG, MEG, ECoG). Since its first announcement, BIDS has evolved to become an organized community with shared governance and a strong impact well beyond the U.S. BRAIN initiative. To date, 131 individuals among faculty, students, and postdocs contributed to the development of the standard and the article describing BIDS has been cited 277 times. Current gaps exist in developing BIDS to effectively support the process of scientific results generation. This is because the standard does not yet describe brain features that can be extracted from MRI data and that are routinely used to perform statistical tests and complete scientific studies. These features comprise connectivity maps, structural and functional connections, major white matter tracts, diffusion signal models as well as white matter tractograms and tractometry. Sharing processed data and features in addition to raw and minimally-processed data is critical to accelerating scientific discovery. This is because substantial effort, software, and hardware instrumentation, and know-how are required to bring raw data to a usable state. One previous project (R24 MH114705) laid the foundations for the BIDS derivatives standard, ultimately leading to the existing Common Derivatives standard. However, the current BIDS derivative standard does not cover advanced data derivatives that describe brain connectivity experiments. The current proposal is to advance the BIDS standard beyond preprocessed data to describe data products generated from experiments and models fit after preprocessing. The project will deliver a community-developed standard describing brain connectivity experiments. The standard will be accompanied by software to validate the datasets.",

        "short-description": "We propose the NeuroImaging Preprocessing workflows (\"NIPreps\") framework, a workbench for the development of workflows and visualization tools for the preprocessing neuroimaging data. NiPreps expands our fMRIPrep software to operate on new imaging modalities and disciplines (e.g., preclinical imaging). Despite some remarkable analysis workflows that display end-to-end consolidation, integrations across applications (e.g., analyses of human and nonhuman data) remain exceptionally challenging. Next-generation neuroimaging workflows require harmonizing measures of wide-ranging phenomena (morphometry, functional activity, and connectivity) from multiple sources (e.g., scanning centers or modalities). Hence, we will evolve fMRIPrep into NiPreps, a software framework integrating BIDS and following the BIDS-Apps specifications. First, the project will consolidate the foundations of the NiPreps integration, with the generalization of fMRIPrep's driving principles and methods across modalities and domains of application. Second, we will expand the portfolio of end-user NiPreps with diffusion, arterial spin labeling (ASL), and molecular imaging \"-Preps.\" Finally, we will address the consolidation of the NiPreps community to ensure the sustainability of the framework, converging the communities around fMRIPrep, dMRIPrep, ASLPrep, and PETPrep with hackathons and docusprints. In short, NIPreps will pave the way towards next-generation imaging, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to seek for a unified statistical framework that is capable of rigorously integrating cross-application and cross-species data analysis.",

        "short-description": "The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive.",

        "short-description": "To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) ? herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research.",

        "short-description": "? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health risk behavior, including poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco and other substance use, causes as much as 40% of the illness, suffering, and early death related to chronic diseases. Non-adherence to medical regimens is an important exemplar of the challenges in changing health risk behavior -- and is common, costly (due to increased utilization of healthcare services), and associated with poor patient outcomes. Although an array of interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting health behavior change, much of this work has been siloed (focused on one disorder at a time). Additionally, interventions are typically intended to engage multiple mechanisms of behavior change, but the mechanisms by which they actually work are infrequently systematically examined. One promising domain of putative behavior change targets is that of self-regulation -- a person's ability to manage cognitive, motivational, and emotional resources to act in accordance with his/her long-term goals. The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health, a national NIH-funded P30 Center of Excellence uses science to inform the development, evaluation, and implementation of technology (web, mobile)-based self- regulation tools for behavior change targeting a wide array of populations and health behaviors. This work examines behavioral phenomena (and the mechanisms by which they work) ranging from substance abuse, mental health, chronic pain management, medication adherence, diet, exercise, diabetes, and smoking. Self- regulation tools offered on mobile platforms enable widespread reach and scalability of effective interventions. In this proposal, we plan to examine putative targets (processes) of behavior change within the self- regulation mechanism domain across contexts, populations, and assays - in 3 primary levels of analysis: (1) psychological (e.g., constructs such as self-efficacy; emotion regulation; response inhibition), (2) behavioral (e.g., tasks of reward responsiveness; temporal horizon), and (3) biological (structural and functional MRI of key neural circuitry). We will evaluate the extent to which we can engage and manipulate these putative targets both within and outside of laboratory settings (using a novel mobile self-regulation monitoring and intervention platform). We will conduct this work with two populations for which behavior plays a critical role in the course of medical regimen adherence, health, and health outcomes: (1) smokers and (2) obese/overweight persons. We will then examine cross-assay validity and cross-context and cross-sample reliability of assays to identify relations among self-regulatory targets. We will finally evaluate the degree to which engaging targets produces a desired change in medical regimen adherence (across 4 week self-regulation interventions) and health behavior among smokers and obese/overweight persons. This project will identify valid and replicable assays of mechanisms of self-regulation across populations to inform an ontology of self-regulation that can ultimately inform development of health behavior interventions of maximal efficacy and potency.",

        "short-description": "This project will enable the reproducible analysis and sharing of large human brain imaging datasets. Imaging the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for the study of the human brain, but the processing of large neuroimaging datasets is often a difficult and time-consuming process. This project will improve the ability of researchers to analyze these data more effectively and share the results. This work will build upon the OpenNeuro project, which provides researchers with the ability to easily upload and share neuroimaging data. The first aim of this project is to develop the ability to process these datasets using national supercomputing resources. Because these resources are both much more powerful and more cost-effective than commercial cloud computing resources, this extension will allow researchers to process larger datasets using more sophisticated analysis procedures. The second aim is to extend the reach of data storage and processing beyond standard neuroimaging datasets to include heterogeneous datasets with clinical and psychological data in addition to brain imaging data. A large study of human brain development will be used as a test case for this extension. The third aim of this project is to engage researchers and software developers in order to develop a broad community that will further extend the reach and capabilities of the proposed technical developments and promote the sustainability of the resources beyond the grant period. The first aim will implement the ability to execute computational workflows using national supercomputing resources through a Science-As-A-Service model, via technologies such as the Agave API and the Singularity container system. This will provide the ability for researchers to execute complex containerized workflows using large datasets, providing a long-term sustainable computational platform for analysis of open data. The second aim will involve the extension of the current OpenNeuro platform to represent data from a large longitudinal neurodevelopmental study, in order to allow the joint analysis of imaging, clinical, psychological, and genetic data. The third aim will engage the relevant user and developer communities through workshops and code sprints. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

OpenNeuro extends the successful OpenfMRI project by encompassing a broader range of neuroimaging data, and by providing the ability to run data processing workflows on the data directly on the platform (using cloud computing resources) and share the results of those workflows alongside the data. The platform focuses on reproducibility through the use of versioned and containerized analysis workflows that are applied to snapshotted data releases. The proposed project would provide support for analysis and sharing of data from BRAIN Initiative projects as well as other interested projects. In addition to this infrastructure, the aims of the project are to develop a robust semi-automated curation workflow, implement new tools for federation, query, and identification, and develop support? ?for? ?advanced? ?data? ?processing? ?workflows.",

        "short-description": "Impairments in cognitive control are central to many mental health disorders (McTeague et al., 2017). In parallel, there is mounting evidence from a range of neuroimaging studies implicating impairments of network computations in disorders of mental health (Fornito et al., 2015). A crucial ?missing piece? bridging these two aspects of brain function is a relatively poor understanding of the way in which the network-level computations of the brain relate to cognitive control processes, and the precise ways in which these relationships fluctuate and unfold over weeks and months in each individual. Before we can understand fluctuations in the trajectories of mental illnesses, we need to first understand the temporal variability of healthy individuals over time. ?Recent ?dense-scanning? datasets that acquire substantially more data per subject provide a potential solution to this challenge, but these studies have lacked width (they include few subjects, e.g., 4-10) and breadth (they focus on individual tasks/states, often the ?resting state?). We will overcome these shortcoming with a dataset scanning 55 subjects each for a total 12 hours over the course of 6 months on 8 unique tasks that span multiple constructs of cognitive control (working memory, attention, set shifting, inhibition, and performance monitoring). The resultant dataset will be wide (i.e. multiple subjects per task), broad (e.g. multiple tasks per construct) and deep (e.g. multiple repetitions of each task over time). This precision neuroscience approach allows us to identify global and local changes in neural networks that are necessary both (a) in preparation for fast, effective controlled performance, and (b) to support flexible post-error and post-conflict control adjustments to improve subsequent performance. Once we have identified these behavioral and neural network signatures of cognitive control that are reproducible across task, construct, session, we will leverage this information in a novel ?targeted network attack? procedure to engineer breakdowns in the network architecture by precision challenges to the cognitive system. Tailored combinations of tasks that rely on overlapping network architectures will be combined to identify specific network features that are ripe for failure in healthy subjects, and as such, represent likely nodes for subsequent failure in disease. Together, this work will uncover novel links between cognitive control and functional brain network architecture across tasks, constructs, and sessions (Aim 1) that are essential for effective and flexible behavior (Aim 2) and are likely to fail across diverse disease states (Aim 3). Our precision neuroscience approach relates closely to the precision medicine initiative at the NIH, as our deep-scanning procedure allows us to identify subject-level network features necessary for effective cognitive control. In addition, by making the data openly accessible to other researchers, we expect these data sets will become an incomparably rich source of information for those studying the essential link between cognitive control and network-level computations.",

        "short-description": "Understanding human brain function requires knowledge of its connectivity: how one structure causally influences other components of the network. A wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders prominently involve dysfunction of connectivity, including neurodegenerative diseases, autism, and mood disorders. Yet current methods provide only indirect measures of connectivity, and none can directly test how one brain structure causally influences another at the level of the whole brain. A unique opportunity to obtain such measures in the human brain comes from using experimental manipulation of activation through direct electrical stimulation, coupled with the whole-brain field-of-view of fMRI (es-fMRI). Our group has obtained IRB approval, and obtained strong initial data of concurrent es-fMRI in a series of 20 neurosurgical patients over the past two years. Here we intend to leverage this unique approach to the application of important open research questions in emotion, and to dissemination of protocols to a wider community of possible performance sites through this U01 mechanism. Three Aims progress through initial validation and quantification of the approach, mapping of brain networks involved in emotion processing (with a focus on the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex), and convergent measures with ECoG and rs-fMRI. These Aims offer a mix of immediate implementation based on strong pilot data, more exploratory implementation during the grant, strong validation components, and future planning. The research focus of all Aims is on how emotion is caused by activity in brain networks. This is the topic with the strongest link to readily accessible brain structures for electrical stimulation in neurosurgical epilepsy patients (amygdala and prefrontal cortex). The work would have immediate implications for deep brain stimulation to treat diseases like depression, and long-term implications for eventually mapping out the effective functional connectome of the human brain. We will aim to provide the research community with short, feasible protocols that could be adopted by many other sites in a concerted effort to map effective connectivity in the human brain, eventually accumulating a database for understanding how individual differences in emotion, in health and disease, arise from differences in network connectivity.",

Within the field of neuroimaging, there is an emerging standard for data/metadata organization, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), which is currently implemented for MRI and is under development for PET and MEG. This standard provides the basis for organization and sharing of raw data for a broad subset of projects funded by the BRAIN Initiative. In the present project we propose to extend and expand the BIDS framework to the description and organization of data/metadata that are derived from these raw data, which we refer to generally as derivatives. This will provide the ability for researchers to share processed data, statistical models and results, and computational modeling results in a way that ensures their usability.",

        "short-description": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology.",

The goal of this project is to greatly enhance the capabilities and performance of the Atlas using state-of-the-art information technologies and national high performance computing (HPC) resources. The result will be a powerful computational tool to assist neuroscience researchers in understanding cognitive and psychological processes and making discoveries about how the brain works, in alignment with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare. The first aim of the project is to restructure the current Cognitive Atlas database so that it will be able to interface more directly with other computing systems, and so that it can be changed in a more flexible way based on new research. The second aim is to utilize a powerful knowledge query system called Deep Dive to extract new knowledge from neuroscience publications and integrate this knowledge into the Cognitive Atlas. To address the intensive computational demands of Deep Dive, an implementation will be piloted on Wrangler, a high performance data analytics computing system hosted at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The proposed project will enhance the computing infrastructure for neuroscience in multiple ways. By updating the system to a state-of-the-art graph database infrastructure, this work will allow much greater use of the system for automated analyses. In addition to enabling analysis of the cognitive neuroscience literature at scale for the current project, the implementation of Deep Dive on Wrangler will allow researchers in many other fields to also take advantage of this state-of-the-art application, which could have important benefits across many different areas of science and technology. This Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award by the CISE Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the SBE Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences and the CISE Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, with funds associated with the NSF Understanding the Brain, BRAIN Initiative activities, and for developing national research infrastructure for neuroscience. This project also aligns with NSF objectives under the National Strategic Computing Initiative.",

        "short-description": "Project Summary The widespread introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) over the past two decades has revolutionized the study of human brain and cognitive function in healthy and clinical populations. Yet the potential utility of fMRI remains constrained by its resource-intensive nature. Because even small, exploratory studies are expensive to conduct, biomedical researchers can collectively test only a small fraction of the research hypotheses that are in principle amenable to fMRI investigation. There is an urgent need for novel methodological approaches that enable rapid and efficient testing of novel theoretical hypotheses by reusing existing fMRI datasets rather than acquiring new ones. To help achieve this goal, we propose a new platform called NeuroScout that will support rapid and flexible cloud-based analysis of existing functional fMRI datasets. Our approach differs importantly from previous infrastructure projects in that, rather than developing a domain-general neuroimaging platform, we focus on extracting maximum utility from a limited set of fMRI experiments--namely, those that use intrinsically high dimensional stimuli such as movies and audio narratives. The proposed work encompasses three Specific Aims. Aim 1 focuses on reducing the burden of re-analyzing existing fMRI by automating much of the analysis process and allowing researchers to easily execute their analyses in the cloud. Aim 2 increases analytical flexibility by developing highly extensible tools for multimodal stimulus annotation. Aim 3 focuses on incentivizing platform use by integrating NeuroScout outputs with existing data sharing, visualization and interpretation platforms such as NeuroVault and Neurosynth. When fully deployed, the NeuroScout platform will provide a turnkey solution for extremely rapid analysis and visualization of existing fMRI data at a marginal cost very close to zero. Researchers will be able to iteratively test and refine hypotheses in domains ranging from visual word recognition to social cognition, and interactively visualize and share their results with the broader research community at the push of a button.",

        "short-description": "Project Summary With the tremendous increase of neuroimaging data, there is a corresponding demand for usable, automated, and robust data analysis tools. Nipype is a mature Python library for efficient and flexible analysis of Big “brain imaging” Data. Its reusable workflows can combine algorithms from a diverse set of existing software packages to generate reproducible results. The goal of this proposal is to further enhance the usability, functionality, and interoperability of Nipype and to widen its dissemination. This will increase its use by researchers and clinicians, boost its impact on biomedical research, and address many of its current limitations. Easier-to-use automation tools can reduce errors, lead to faster biomedical discoveries, and facilitate the transition from bench to bedside. From a software engineering standpoint, the goal is to offer a well-designed, cross-platform, and extensible dataflow computing solution that is intuitive and easy to use. We propose to build an interactive and intuitive web-based platform on top of the current extensive feature set of Nipype that interoperates with existing databases, software, and other workflow services. The result will be a generalizable, scalable, extensible, and tested infrastructure that minimizes complex programming interfaces to easier-to-use web applications. Nipype will still retain its extensible plugin architecture behind this web- based platform to allow continued inclusion of new software packages and algorithms, and execution on multiple platforms. Users will be able to use the most appropriate analysis strategies for their data. This platform will not only allow continued use of familiar software, but provide immediate exposure to the latest software tools for data analyses. For analysis, users will have access to complete provenance allowing others to reproduce their steps. We will interact with NeuroVault and NeuroSynth to provide a seamless transition between data, processing, sharing, and interpreting results. Finally, to sustain such an open and collaborative effort, we will train users and developers through hands-on workshops and webinars, encouraging them to take advantage of an expanding ecosystem for efficient and reproducible analysis. While the architecture will be initially deployed within the brain imaging community, we will adopt common standards to ensure interoperability with the greater biomedical imaging community. By continuing to engage the user community and extending the ecosystem for research computing, the project will lower the barrier for easy and efficient computation on large datasets, with the goal of faster development of treatment options.",

        "short-description": "The Columbia University Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) Resource and Coordinating Center (RCC) has been highly successful in coordinating SOBC research efforts, developing digital tools to promote the experimental medicine approach, and disseminating SOBC research practices and products. We now propose to expand on the tools we have developed, to create novel opportunities for basic and applied/clinical science to converge on mechanisms of behavior change. Further, we will continue to serve as a hub for scientists within and outside the SOBC Network to collect, organize, evaluate, discuss, and disseminate rigorous behavioral science. In close collaboration with NIH and the SOBC Network we will: -Expand the SOBC Measures Repository to include both intervention materials and measures of behavioral outcomes—alongside measures of mechanisms. Open the Repository for curation by all scientists, and promote self-sustaining user engagement through delivery of digital tools to (a) organize constructs into visual taxonomies and (b) leverage systematic review data to identify novel opportunities for mechanistic research. Rapidly test and optimize Repository tools and features. -Bring basic and applied/clinical scientists together to promote discovery and improve measurement tools and practices, through collaboration, research syntheses, and support of pilot research. -Conduct outreach and dissemination of the SOBC experimental medicine approach and mechanistic research broadly, through drafting and disseminating best practice guidelines, and developing tools for incorporating and communicating mechanisms-focused research. We will also continue to create engaging conference workshops, webinars, educational video/web/podcast content, and engage with national and international scientific organizations through meetings and joint communications. -Integrate SOBC with related efforts, and detail the role of SOBC/early phase mechanism-focused optimization in the ORBIT framework, NIH Stage Model, and the RE-AIM model. -Conduct systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of the behavior change literature, to test the impact of applying the experimental medicine approach on research products, and to identify additional potential targets for future validation or research. The SOBC program has begun a profound shift in how behavioral scientists think about behavior change. Over the past 5 years, we played a key role in shaping the SOBC message and building tools to help researchers apply it. Now we propose to ensure its lasting impact by making those tools more rigorous, intuitive, and usable—and by making them accessible to the broader field. Our goal is to make the case for behavioral science to adopt the experimental medicine approach by showing that it improves research impact, and by making adoption so simple that it becomes the default approach.",

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal structural and functional connectivity (interaction between brain regions) is central to the pathophysiology of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Modern neuroimaging techniques and analytic strategies provide an unprecedented capacity to more fully characterize the functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Individuals with psychotic illness and their unaffected relatives have abnormal connectivity, suggesting that at least a portion of psychotic disconnectivity is associated with genetic predisposition for the diseases. Imaging-based connectivity endophenotypes are ideally suited to aid the functional characterization of putative risk genes, allowing us to move beyond a genotype-phenotype association to delineating mechanisms that give rise to psychotic illnesses. Recently, large-scale exome sequencing in individuals of European ancestry provided the strongest evidence to date for specific genetic variants that increase risk for psychosis. These primarily rare mutations were spread across gene networks involved in neuronal processes, including calcium channels and postsynaptic signaling. Our goals are to replicate these promising genetic findings in a different ethnic group, African-Americans, and determine whether and how these gene sets impact psychotic disconnectivity. African-Americans, an underserved population, have ~32% more highly deleterious non-synonymous rare variants in these networks than individuals of European ancestry, improving our power to detect rare variants. Our aims are to: (1) use modern MRI acquisition and analysis techniques based on the Human Connectome Project to document psychotic disconnectivity in 750 African Americans (375 with a psychotic disorder and 375 demographically matched comparison subjects). We will test hypotheses that diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis are associated with reduced global functional connectivity but intact global structural connectivity, combined with aberrant connectivity between specific regions or tracts; (2) conduct whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the influence of rare non-synonymous variants from genes in previously identified gene sets on psychosis risk using a network-centered analysis strategy. We will test hypotheses that the voltage-gated calcium ion channel, and the ARC-associated scaffold protein and the NMDAR postsynaptic signaling complexes influence diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis; and (3) apply this same network-centric test to determine if gene sets implicated in illness risk also influence functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Linking these genetic pathways to psychotic disconnectivity will provide mechanistic insights into the genomic influences on psychotic illness. Our collaborative application includes sites at Yale/Hartford Hospital (DC Glahn PI), Stanford (RA Poldrack PI) and Texas Biomedical Research Institute (J Blangero PI). Our results should bolster our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychotic illness and provide important clues for traversing the chasm between identified genetic networks and the behaviorally defined disorder.",

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic children are disproportionately affected by obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Mounting evidence points to sugar consumption, specifically sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), as a key modifiable factor contributing to obesity and T2D. SSB are primarily sweetened with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which consists of glucose and fructose in varying proportions, and the physiological responses of HFCS on metabolic health are not fully understood. Studies elucidating the mechanism of action of how HFCS impacts metabolic health, particularly in high-risk Hispanic children, are warranted. A hypothesized link between high sugar intake and metabolic disease risk involves brain reward pathways implicated in addiction. New findings with adolescents demonstrate that frequent consumption of ice cream, independent of body fat, is associated with a reduction in reward system activity, similar to the tolerance observed in drug addiction. To date, no study has examined how SSB intake impacts brain reward and addiction pathways in children, nor assessed whether this relationship differs by frequency of SSB intake. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to examine and compare how pictures of SSB and actual SSB receipt impacts brain reward pathways, food choice, subsequent food/beverage intake, and metabolic pathways in overweight Hispanic children (7-9 y), between frequent and naive drinkers. We propose a cross-sectional study of 50 Hispanic children (7-9 y), half who are frequent SSB consumers (i.e., report e 2 SSB serv/day; n=50) and half who are na¿ve drinkers (i.e., report d 2 serv/wk; n=50). Subjects will undergo two fMRI paradigms: a food choice task in which they are presented with pictures of foods/beverages that vary in their palatability/energy density and rate the value of each item, and a probabilistic reward paradigm using SSB (sweetened with HFCS) and a tasteless control. Immediately following the scan, subjects will be exposed to an ad libitum food tray, which will include a variety of healthy and unhealthy foods/beverages. Blood will be drawn at baseline (before scan), immediately after scan, and at 10-minute intervals during ad libitum food exposure to assess glucose, insulin, and gut peptides. Satiety and fullness measures will be collected at those same time points. Specific aims are: 1) to examine and compare how exposure to pictures of energy-dense foods/beverages influence choice, value, and reward pathways (striatum, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula) and examine how anticipation and receipt of SSB versus tasteless solution elicits activation of brain reward pathways between frequent and naive drinkers; and 2) to examine and compare how exposure to SSB intake in the magnet impacts subsequent acute ad libitum intake, glucose, insulin, gut peptides, and perceived satiety and hunger responses between frequent and naive drinkers. These findings will not only identify mechanisms involved in possible SSB addiction, but will also identify children most at risk for chronic sugar intake who may require more targeted interventions.",

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a risk period for the onset of drug use, with more individuals initiating drug use during these years than any other time in life. In addition, those individuals who initiate drug use earlier in adolescence are at greater risk for developing drug abuse and dependence later in life. Adolescents are known to engage disproportionately in many types of risky behavior, such as reckless driving, illicit drug use, and unsafe sex. Research has aimed to determine whether the development of neural processing could lead to the post- adolescent drop in risk-taking behavior. While several studies have demonstrated shifts in reward sensitivity across adolescence, very little research has examined the development of sensitivity to punishment. Recent research has demonstrated behaviorally that the ability to learn from punishment continues to develop throughout adolescence. It is unclear, however, if this is because children and adolescents simply find negative events less aversive than adults, or if, instead, they find punishment equally unpleasant, but are unable to incorporate this information into a learning signal, known as a prediction error signal, that is necessary to learn to approach or avoid stimuli that have previously been rewarded or punished, respectively. The proposed study aims to dissociate between these two possibilities by having groups of children, adolescents, and young adults perform a valence-modulated probabilistic learning task in an MRI scanner, where they be rewarded for correct choices during one block, and punished for incorrect choices during another. BOLD response will be measured in a contrast of negative feedback vs. positive feedback and compared across age groups to determine developmental differences in overall response to punishment, and separately prediction error response to punishment will be measured. We predict that no age differences will emerge in the negative feedback vs. positive feedback contrast, but children and adolescents will show a diminished prediction error response relative to adults.",

        "short-description": "PROJECT SUMMARY The human functional neuroimaging literature has experienced sustained and explosive growth, making it difficult to effectively glean insights from this vast knowledge base. Previously, we introduced Neurosynth, a web-based framework for automated fMRI synthesis that supports meta-analysis at scale across over 12,000 studies. We subsequently extended the ecosystem by developing a powerful platform for expert-driven data annotation, enabling researchers to define and execute custom image-based meta-analyses. Although the Neurosynth framework has become a widely used resource in the neuroimaging community, the laborious challenge of annotating studies at scale remains. We previously addressed this problem by using frequency-based text-mining techniques to extract meaning from the abstracts of articles, but these methods were unable to make fine-grained distinctions between neuroscientific concepts or encode methodological details. Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and artificial intelligence promise to extract accurate information from unstructured texts with little to no labeled data using Zero Shot Learning. However, the application of state-of-the-art language models to the neuroimaging literature requires a systematic framework to ensure machine comprehension accurately captures known concepts, and robust infrastructure to retrieve information from the literature at scale. The overarching goal of the present project period is to bridge the gap between manual annotation and fully automated meta-analysis, by extending the Neurosynth framework to leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing models to enable precise large-scale automated meta-analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop an extensible framework for information retrieval and validation from neuroimaging articles, with a focus on features relevant to neuroimaging meta-analysis such as study participant demographics (e.g. sample size, age, phenotype), methodological details, and semantic concepts mapped onto expert-defined ontologies. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy infrastructure for continuous retrieval and processing of the neuroimaging literature, ensuring the timely acquisition of new articles and transforming our meta-analytic study database into a comprehensive knowledge base. In Aim 3, we will develop an interactive researcher-in-the-loop platform meta-analysis, enabling users to use extracted study information to find and identify studies, create gold-standard meta-analyses, and browse hundreds of pre-generated large-scale meta-analyses, enabling discovery-driven science. Meta-analyses will be automatically updated, transforming them from a static to a “living” scientific product that remains relevant and up-to-date. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful and flexible tools for synthesizing the neuroimaging literature at a large scale and with unprecedented precision and ease. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient meta-analysis across a broad range of clinical and basic research questions.",

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positive changes in behavior are essential to improved health. Whereas such changes can often be instituted through intervention, long-term maintenance of these changes can be very difficult, as highlighted in this RFA. An understanding of how behaviors can be replaced and maintained is necessary in order to most effectively promote sustained beneficial changes in health-related behavior. The work proposed here will focus on understanding the brain systems that support the implementation and maintenance of behavioral change. Our work is based on the idea that there are fundamental differences between first-learned behaviors and later- learned behaviors, which result in lasting difficulties in maintenance of new behaviors in comparison to the old ones that they are meant to supplant. Although later-learned behaviors are often viewed as replacing first- learned ones, there is substantial behavioral evidence that first-learned behaviors are not over-written as they are extinguished, but instead are retained in a latent state. Further, it appears that maintenance of a secondary behavior requires continued suppression of the primary one in addition to acquisition of the new response. Finally, secondary behaviors appear to be substantially more context-dependent than primary ones, which results in decreased generalization to new situations. Using a combination of sophisticated neuroimaging techniques, the proposed work will characterize the brain processes that are associated with first-learned versus later-learned behaviors, and test a set of methods to improve the resilience of later-learned behaviors, with the ultimate goal of improving the long-term effectiveness of behavior change interventions.",

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests funds to complete construction of a new home for the Imaging Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This center is currently located several miles from the main campus, which limits its effectiveness and availability. The proposed project would move the Imaging Research Center to a space within the newly constructed Norman Hackerman Building, located at the center of the UT Austin campus. The new location would allow the installation of additional imaging resources, including several imaging systems for small animals, as well as incorporating it more centrally into the biomedical research community. The new center will be directly connected to the building's vivarium, providing an optimal setup for animal imaging. In addition, the project would provide space for a newly purchased 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system, which would support a broad range of imaging projects in humans and other species. The Norman Hackerman Building, which is replacing the Experimental Science Building of 1950, will provide UT Austin with an advanced facility for research and education in the Life Sciences. The 293,768 gross square foot building will offer modern, technology-enabled seminar rooms and undergraduate teaching laboratories, as well as office and research laboratory space for cutting-edge academic programs, including the Institute for Neuroscience, the Center for Learning and Memory, the Section of Neurobiology, and Synthetic Organic Chemistry in addition to the Imaging Research Center. The building is located within two block of nearly every biomedical research program on the UT campus. Its design incorporates the state of the art in sustainable building practices and technologies. Imaging methods have become central to nearly every aspect of biomedical research, and the availability of new imaging techniques at UT Austin has the potential to greatly advance research on campus. UT Austin has particular strength in neuroscience and cancer research, both of which would greatly benefit from the proposed improvements.",

        "short-description": "The goal of this group was to assess whether new developments in areas of data mining, graph theory, and causal inference might provide better tools for the analysis of brain imaging, particularly functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The diversity of disciplinary backgrounds participating in this effort is symbolic of the breadth and depth of the data processing problems that confront further development and refinement of brain imaging technologies. \n \nThe best way to understand these problems is to contrast what it means to understand brain \nactivity\n versus brain \ninteractivity\n. The brain images we see in the popular press and even in most scientific articles are representations of brain activity. They show areas of the brain that are active when the participant in the experiment is performing an experimental task. These are static images and the activated areas are identified by choosing an activation threshold with areas in the brain above that threshold appearing as patterns of spots in the brain image. Neuroscientists know, however, that the brain is a highly connected organ, where interactions among brain areas occur simultaneously or sequentially, when study participants are performing the experimental task. Thus, to understand the brain we must understand the interactivity, both spatial and temporal, among brain areas. Ideally, we would like to understand the causal relations that occur in activated brain areas: Does activation in area A cause activity in area B, or is B the cause of A? The brain relies on networks to execute tasks, but what is the causal path through the network?\n \nThe collaborative plans to develop improved simulations of fMRI data, further test and validate their current algorithms, compare their methods with those of dynamic causal modeling, and improve variable selection for developing causal models of brain circuits. In addition, this project will move outside basic research to assess how these tools could be used to identify neural disruptions associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, they will also produce a handbook for the analysis of brain activity.\n \nOver the next three years, this collaborative plans to develop improved simulations of fMRI data, further test and validate their current algorithms, compare their methods with those of dynamic causal modeling, and improve variable selection for developing causal models of brain circuits.

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research aims to develop a framework for integrating knowledge about brain, mind, and behavior across multiple disciplines, which we refer to as a }cognitive atlas. This framework extends the existing knowledge and software architecture for neuroanatomic atlas development that has been established and is now under major development in the UCLA Center for Computational Biology (CCB). A comprehensive approach to understanding mental illness requires translation between syndrome, cognition, behavior, and biology, but increasing specialization within each of these domains hinders interdisciplinary communication, insights and discoveries. The proposed project aims to bridge these gaps by developing a system for the representation of knowledge about cognitive tasks, cognitive processes, and brain structure. We propose to harness new technologies for collaborative knowledge-building along with automated methods of literature mining, to develop a flexible web-based system that will support the consolidation of distributed knowledge about cognitive phenotypes and allow creation of multi-level interdisciplinary links. This system will provide the foundation for involvement of experts in the formalization of their domain knowledge. The resulting knowledge base will provide an }atlas} that allows the mapping of cognitive phenotypes onto biomedical knowledge at manifold other levels, from genes to complex syndromes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to improve public health by enabling interdisciplinary research on mental disease to result in discovery of treatments and preventions that would not otherwise be possible with current approaches. It will extend the work of the National Centers for Biological Computing to develop a knowledge base that relates psychological functions to brain systems. This knowledge base spanning syndromes, cognitive processes, neural systems, and molecular genetics will additionally serve as an evolving and up-to-date educational resource for scientists, practitioners, and patients. The system developed in this project will also enhance biomedical knowledge and discovery more broadly by providing new tools for collaborative knowledge building.",

        "short-description": "The Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics (CNP) advances the NIH Roadmap Initiative by assembling an interdisciplinary research team to address major unsolved challenges in research on behavioral disorders. The CNP leverages the newdiscipline of phenomics - the systematic study of human phenotypes on a genome-wide level - by integrating basic, clinical and information sciences. Neuropsychiatric disorders have enormous public health significance, and there is currently a broad chasm between the basic and clinical research strategies used to study these disorders. The CNP breaks down artificial boundaries between psychiatric syndromes by studying important brain-relevant phenotypes across different diagnoses, and by combining basic and clinical sciences within the same projects. The CNP further focuses on developing novel analytic tools to study complex multivariate phenotypes on a genome-wide scale, and informatics approaches for the graphical visualization, representation and testing of multi-level interdisciplinary hypotheses spanning concepts from genome to syndrome. The CNP comprises 8 components led by a team of 52 investigators representing diverse disciplines. The CNP team will execute five interlocking R01 projects supported by two P30 cores and this U54 Coordinating Center. The U54 comprises: (1) an Administrative Group; (2) an Executive Operations Team that will collaboratively complete day-to-day consortium-wide planning, budget management, and evaluation activities to assure optimal integration among the research projects and cores; (3) the Steering Committee for twice-yearly reviews of progress and binding votes on critical strategic directions and resources allocations; and (4) an External Advisory Board to provide annual evaluative review, guiding performance through recommendations to the Steering Committee and Executive Operations Team. Interaction and innovation will be further promoted by annual retreats with invited external experts; a series of other knowledge-sharing activities; and a proof-of- concept pilot project program. The U54 team will also manage data sharing and dissemination activities consortium-wide, ensuring that the conceptual and data products of the CNP are freely available as a resource to the international research community.",

        "short-description": "This application requests five years of support to establish a multidisciplinary research center at UCLA entitled \"Translational Research to Enhance Cognitive Control (TRECC)\" as a part of the NIMH Centers for Intervention Development and Applied Research (CIDAR) program. Utilizing our expertise in animal models, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, neuropsychopharmacology, behavioral therapies, genetics, we will advance the science of treatment approaches for the cognitive deficits common to a large number of neuropsychiatric disorders afflicting children and adolescents. We will especially focus on pediatric disorders with prominent problems of cognitive control, particularly the often overlapping disorders of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette Syndrome (TS), due to their unmet treatment needs, prevalence, morbidity and comorbidity, and shared pathophysiologic features. Ultimately, we believe our work will be relevant to an even larger group of children with other conditions, but who share the dimension of significant deficits in behavior regulation, cognitive processing, and judgement. The central theme of the UCLA CIDAR TRECC Center is the understanding and modeling of the mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits shared by a range of developmental psychopathologies leading to the development and testing of targeted and more efficacious treatments to enhance cognition in these conditions. Our focus is in direct response to the PA's call for the development of treatment approaches for clinical targets of illnesses which clearly influence morbidity but which are not sufficiently remediated by extant treatments. Impaired cognition in developmental psychopathologies clearly serves as a major determinant of functioning and long-term outcome. There is a great need to recognize cognitive enhancement in pediatric disorders as a primary treatment target and to develop and test new treatment approaches. If successful, such efforts hold the promise of significantly improving the long-term outcome of individuals with these disabilities. The UCLA CIDAR Center will approach this theme through the completion of four interacting multi-level studies in animals and humans, utilizing the resources developed and made available through three research cores supported by the CIDAR Center.",

        "short-description": "Habit, automaticity, and cognitive control\nHumans are endowed with a spectacular capacity for conscious thinking and reasoning. However, just as impressive and perhaps even more important for human survival are our abilities to perform complex routine behaviors with relatively little conscious effort. Most activities that are performed repeatedly become \"automatized\" in the sense that they can be performed with little or no conscious effort, freeing us up to do other things at the same time. Driving is a good example of this kind of automaticity: Most skilled drivers can carry on multiple tasks (such as drinking coffee or holding a conversation with a passenger) while still maintaining control over the car and successfully getting to their destination. Many of the details of driving are executed with great skill yet never seem to enter consciousness.  Research into the acqusition of skills has led to the proposal that behaviors can be characterized as either \"controlled\" or \"automatic,\" and has suggested that automatized behaviors cannot be controlled. An oft-cited example of this is the Stroop effect: If a person is asked to name the color of the ink that a word is written in, he or she will be slowed down if the printed word does not match the ink color (see Figure).",

        "short-description": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Recent studies have indicated that training-induced cortical plasticity may offer promising opportunities for the remediation of several different neurological conditions, such as stroke-induced movement disorders, dystonia, and dyslexia. However, extremely intensive training has been required, and has yielded results that, although promising, fall far short of a full cure. For this reason, there has been much interest in attempts to enhance cortical plasticity, including the use of noradrenergic drugs such as amphetamine in stroke-rehabilitation, and disinhibition of motor cortex in healthy subjects using ischemic nerve block. The study proposed here will investigate a novel approach, exploiting a newly available opportunity to apply plasticity-enhancing results from the animal literature to studies in humans. Experiments in animals have shown that cortical plasticity can be greatly enhanced by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). New drugs, known as cholinesterase inhibitors, that safely and effectively increase ACh levels in humans have recently been developed and FDA-approved. The specific drug that we propose to use is galantharnine hydrobromide (trade name Reminyl). The effect of the drug on cortical plasticity will be assessed using both visual psychophysics and fMR1. The psychophysical measure will be the rate at which the subjects learn to more accurately perform a simple visual perceptual learning task: learning to discriminate the orientation of a grating. The hypothesis to be tested is that learning of the visual task that takes place under the influence of the drug will proceed more quickly than learning that is paired with a placebo. Functional MRI will be used to assess the effect of the drug on cortical plasticity, by comparing the pre-training versus post-training brain activation changes that are caused by learning the visual task while on the drug against those caused by learning the task on placebo. If the novel method of enhancing plasticity that is proposed here should turn out to be successful, then there could be a wide range of potential clinical and practical applications.",
