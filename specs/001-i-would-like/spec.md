# Feature Specification: Academic Database Web Interface & Modernization

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to refactor and extend this existing project. First, I would like to create a web interface that will allow viewing and editing of the collections in the database. Second, I would like to allow updating of the database with new information from the data sources, while still maintaining any edits to existing entries. Third, I would like to refactor the code to make it simpler and more maintainable when possible. Please examine the existing codebase and develop a new spec for the extension/refactor. Use well-established frameworks like Django."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  Identified three main objectives: web interface, database updates, code refactoring
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: web viewing/editing, data source syncing, Django migration, maintainability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Authentication/authorization approach needs clarification
   ’ Data validation rules need clarification
   ’ Deployment strategy needs clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  Clear user flows identified for academic researchers
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  Database collections and web interface entities defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Some implementation uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Academic researchers need a web-based interface to manage their academic database, allowing them to view, edit, and update their publications, collaborations, and academic information while maintaining data integrity when syncing with external sources.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher has an existing academic database, **When** they access the web interface, **Then** they can view all collections (publications, collaborators, funding, etc.) in a user-friendly format
2. **Given** a researcher finds an error in their publication data, **When** they edit the entry through the web interface, **Then** the changes are persisted and protected from being overwritten during future data source updates
3. **Given** new publications are available from external APIs, **When** the system performs an update, **Then** new entries are added while preserving any manual edits to existing entries
4. **Given** a researcher wants to export their CV data, **When** they request a CV generation, **Then** the system produces formatted output using the most current database information
5. **Given** multiple users need to access the system, **When** they log in, **Then** they can only view and edit their own academic data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external API data conflicts with manual edits?
- How does the system handle duplicate publications from different sources?
- What happens when a user tries to edit critical system metadata?
- How does the system behave when external APIs are unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web interface for viewing all database collections (publications, collaborators, funding, talks, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow authenticated users to edit individual records through web forms
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve user edits when updating database from external sources
- **FR-004**: System MUST track which fields have been manually edited vs automatically populated
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide search and filtering capabilities across all collections
- **FR-006**: System MUST support batch operations for managing multiple records
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate data integrity before saving changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide audit trail of all manual changes
- **FR-009**: System MUST support exporting data in existing CV formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle concurrent access by multiple users safely
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - local accounts, institutional SSO, ORCID OAuth?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement role-based access control for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single researcher vs multi-user environment not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST backup data before major updates with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period and recovery process not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents authenticated researchers with access permissions and preferences
- **Database Collection**: Existing collections (publications, collaborators, funding, talks, education, employment, distinctions, memberships, service, coauthors) with enhanced metadata tracking
- **Edit History**: Tracks manual modifications, timestamps, and user attribution for audit purposes
- **Sync Status**: Tracks last update times and conflict resolution for external data sources
- **Web Session**: Manages user authentication state and interface preferences
