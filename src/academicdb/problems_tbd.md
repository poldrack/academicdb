[x] ~~The progress window is not fully tracking the onging processing when a full database sync is performed.  In particular, it never says that Scopus ID matching is happening - it stops at PMC matching.  Please ensure that all steps in the process are reflected in the progress window.~~ **FIXED**:

**Root cause**: Progress tracking in the comprehensive sync function was not properly updating progress percentages for postprocessing tasks, causing the progress bar to appear stuck after PMC matching while Scopus ID enrichment was running in the background.

**Solution implemented**:
1. **Improved progress granularity**: Split total progress calculation into distinct phases with proper step allocation (sync sources: 30 steps each, enrichment: 20 steps, postprocessing: 15 steps)
2. **Per-task progress updates**: Each postprocessing task now updates both the current step description AND progress percentage
3. **Better step distribution**: Postprocessing steps are evenly distributed among tasks (PMC lookup and Scopus author ID enrichment)
4. **Progress continuity**: Progress advances even when individual tasks fail, preventing the UI from getting stuck
5. **Clearer phase indicators**: Progress window now shows distinct phases: "Database Synchronization", "Data Enrichment", and "Post-Processing"

[x] ~~the positional matching of authors for identification of Scopus IDs seems to
  be breaking on at least two occasions (10.1093/braincomms/fcae120 and
  10.3389/fninf.2012.00009).  are you checking to make sure that the two
  publications have the same number of authors? it seems that one author may
  have been skipped in one of the records leading to a mismatch.  When a mismatch occurs, we should use the Scopus entry for our database entry, replacing the mismatching author list from the original entry.~~ **FIXED**:

**Root cause**: Positional matching algorithm did not handle cases where author counts differed between the publication record and Scopus data, leading to incorrect author-Scopus ID assignments.

**Solution implemented**:
1. **Enhanced author count validation**: Added explicit check for author count mismatches between publication and Scopus records
2. **Authoritative Scopus replacement**: When counts don't match, completely replace the publication's author list with Scopus data instead of attempting name-based matching
3. **Improved logging**: Added detailed logging to show when author counts match/mismatch and what action is taken
4. **Positional match validation**: Added basic name similarity checking to warn when positional matches seem questionable
5. **Audit trail**: Added edit history tracking when author lists are replaced due to mismatches
6. **New method `replace_authors_with_scopus_data`**: Handles complete author list replacement while preserving necessary metadata
7. **Enhanced validation with `names_reasonably_similar`**: Provides early warning for potentially incorrect positional matches

[x] ~~the progress bar when using the "Sync All Databases" function is not working correctly - it shows "initializing" but then goes away as if the sync was complete, when in reality the sync is ongoing (as seen from the progress messages printed to the server console)~~ **FIXED**:

**Root cause**: The form was submitting normally causing page reload, instead of being handled by JavaScript AJAX
**Solution implemented**:
1. **Fixed form submission**: Prevented default form submission and handled entirely via AJAX with proper headers
2. **Fixed thread synchronization**: Background sync function now receives sync_id parameter to ensure progress tracking matches
3. **Updated view responses**: Return JSON for AJAX requests instead of redirecting
4. **Added race condition protection**: Pre-initialize progress data before starting thread
5. **Updated command names**: Fixed postprocessing to use correct `enrich_scopus_authors` command
6. **Added comprehensive debugging**: Console logging and error handling for progress tracking
7. **Memory cleanup**: Added automatic cleanup of completed sync progress data
