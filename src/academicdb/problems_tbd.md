[x] The details about specific publications are still missing from the CV.  for example, for 10.1126/science.1134239, there is information about the page range in metadata['raw_data']['pageRange'] and the volume in metadata['raw_data']['volume'] but this is not being displayed in the reference.  I think that the publication ingestion from the database should populate fields in the main publication record for page range and volume, if those are present.

**FIXED**: Updated CV renderer in `academic/cv_renderer.py` to extract volume and page information from nested metadata structures, specifically `metadata['raw_data']['volume']` and `metadata['raw_data']['pageRange']`. The CV now properly displays volume and page range information for publications like 10.1126/science.1134239.
