Fixed problems marked with [x]
**IMPORTANT**: Only mark a problem as fixed once the user has confirmed that the fix worked.

[ ] Remove the country entry in the address field for the rendered CV

[ ] The "Education and Training" section of the CV should include all education and qualification items from the ORCID record. It currently appears to be excluding entries that are marked as "Qualification" rather than "Education", such as postdoctoral training.

[ ] We need to include a tab for editorial activities, which cannot be properly represented within ORCID.  These should be uploaded to a table (similar to teaching or talks), from a file like the one at data/editorial.csv.  The listing of Editorial Duties in the rendered CV should group these activities together by role.

[ ] Activities listed as "Invited Positions" in the ORCID Professional Activities should be included in the "Honors and Awards" section of the rendered CV.

[ ] In the rendered CV, funding sources should be sorted by their end date rather than their start date.

[ ] If a funding source entry has a grant number, that number should be listed following the name of the agency.  If the entry has a URL then it should be linked from the grant number.

[ ] Preprints in the CV should be listed in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

[ ] Conference presentations should be ordered in reverse chronological order within the year, based on the Month field.  You may want to create a numerical representation of the month and then sort by that.
